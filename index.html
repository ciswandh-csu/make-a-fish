      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Camille! I'm a transfer student starting my first year at CSUMB. I
        like to draw, write, and make fibercrafts in my free time. I've made
        several art pieces for a drawing class last semester that I'm proud of.
        I hope to brush up on my HTML/CSS and get more familiar with JavaScript.
